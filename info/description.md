You are given an unknown number within the range of 1 to 1000, inclusive.
Your task is to **guess what the number is by performing a series of guesses**

Your solution will need to guess the number by submitting an **integer divisor** and the **number you guessed**.
At each attempt you will get information about previous guesses. 
Each guess is represented as an array which contains the remainder result along with your previous divisor.

You should find the number within minimum guesses (but not more than 13). 
The final result will be defined as an average of attempt numbers.
